# RIT Library System with Visitor Pattern (HW7)

### Project Description

This Python project demonstrates the implementation of a library system for RIT using the Visitor pattern. The system manages various library items such as books and DVDs, allowing users to perform operations like borrowing, returning, and checking availability without modifying the individual classes of the library items.

### Features

- **Library Items**: Includes classes for representing books and DVDs in the library.
- **Visitor Pattern**: Utilizes the Visitor pattern to perform operations on library items without modifying their classes.
- **Catalog Management**: Provides methods for adding items to the library catalog, borrowing, returning, and checking availability of items.
- **Example Usage**: Demonstrates the usage of the library system with example interactions in the main script.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run `python library_system.py` script to see the example usage and interactions with the library system.

### Usage

```bash
python library_system.py
```
